========= Installation =========

You can install the theme through the WordPress installer under "Themes" > "Install themes" by searching for it.
Alternatively you can download the file, unzip it and move the unzipped contents to the "wp-content/themes" folder of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the theme.

========= Instructions =========

Story offers customisation options via Theme Customizer, which can be found under Appereance > Customize.
* Logo upload. You can upload your own image to serve as website logo. If no image is uploaded website title will be displayed instead. Max logo width: 1140px;
* Color scheme. Story comes with seven predefined colour schemes to choose from.
* Custom Background - you can set your own custom background using WordPress built in background option (Appearance > Background).

If you wish to further customize the theme I recommend using My Custom CSS plugin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/my-custom-css/ for CSS only ), or creating a child theme.

For best visual effect I recommend using large (at least 820px wide) images as post featured image.

If Story theme is being activated on already existing website, it's highly recommended to regenerate post thumbnails using the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin (http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/).
